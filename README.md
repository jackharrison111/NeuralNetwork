A repo to store the python project for the ML course, carried out collaboratively with Poppy Nikou.

An artificial neural network is created from scratch, using different gradient descent algorithms to compare their properties.

The final report can be found in the 'final project.pdf' file, which uses the code in the 'Investigation into momentum in neural networks.py' file.
